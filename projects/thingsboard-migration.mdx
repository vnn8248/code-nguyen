## Overview

Our dev department has a little something called the “kill list.” Basically, it is a list of services that we want to get rid of for many reasons. Thingsboard was high on that list because of its inaccurate data reporting and also, it cost us a pretty penny. Our team built an in-house replacement for the database; however before we flipped the switch off on Thingsboard, we wanted to have a pretty high level of confidence that the new database was catching everything it needed to catch.

Objective - find all the deltas. How many records existed in Thingsboard that don’t exist in our in-house database and vice versa. We analyzed the anomalies afterwards.

## Complexities

I picked up this project after a fellow colleague left the company. The project was half-baked but I had a decent starting point.

Here’s a nomination for the most obvious statement award - databases are big. Comparing two databases (that are both very big) is a quick way to learn about Big O. Luckily, I didn’t have to worry about speed on my script but I knew I had to keep it reasonable in order to iterate at a non-annoying pace. These are the fun nerdy side lessons I enjoy learning about.

There is a code snippet below:

```
export function myComponent(){
    return (
        <p>test</p>
    )
}
```
