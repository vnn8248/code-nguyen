## Overview

Our dev department has a little something called, “The Printer List.” It’s a list inspired from the geeky cult-classic movie, “Office Space.” Basically, it’s a list of services that we want to get rid of for many (mostly frustrating) reasons.

Thingsboard was high on that list because of its inaccurate data reporting and also, it cost us a pretty penny.

Our team built an in-house replacement for the database; however before we flipped the switch off on Thingsboard, we wanted to have a pretty high level of confidence that the new database was catching everything it needed to catch.

Objective - find all the deltas. How many records existed in Thingsboard that don't exist in our in-house database and vice versa. We analyzed the anomalies afterwards.

## Complexities

I picked up this project after a fellow colleague left the company. The project was half-baked but I had a decent starting point.

Here’s a nomination for the most obvious statement award - databases are big. Comparing two databases (that are both very big) is a quick way to learn about Big O. Luckily, I didn’t have to worry about speed (too much) on my script but I knew I had to keep it reasonable in order to iterate at a non-annoying pace. These are the fun geeky side lessons I enjoy learning about.

There is a code snippet below:

```
export function myComponent(){
    return (
        <p>test</p>
    )
}
```
