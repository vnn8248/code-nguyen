## Overview

We have a couple new IoT devices to offer to our customers. Along with a couple improvements for the K4 Home Hub.

We made an improvement to the way our Home Hub roams on poor wifi signals. We set up a cron job to let wpa_supplicant decide whether to switch Wifi network access points based on a signal strength comparison.

IoT Devices released

- Alfred lock
- Radio thermostat
- Jasco smart leak sensor
- Jasco no-neutral dimmer
- Honeywell thermostat

## Complexities

What is within our realm of control? As a part of the market we serve, some of the communities we serve have out-dated Wifi infrastructure that leads to unpredictable reception. That, we canâ€™t do much about.

What can we do? We can think of ways to work with the ingredients we were given.
