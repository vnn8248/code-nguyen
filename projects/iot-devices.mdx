## Overview

K4 provides home automation for senior living communities. Our current offering of IoT devices includes switches, dimmers, motion sensors, and thermostats.

Using protocols such as Z-Wave, Zigbee, and Matter, our team goal is to continually integrate new devices to improve our product offering for our customers. We have introduced door locks, blinds, garage door sensors, water leak sensors, and a variety of new switches, dimmers, and thermostats.

Since joining K4, we have released over 10 new IoT devices.

## Complexities

Each device comes with its own unique set of configuration parameters, properties, and variables. Integrating testing is critical to ensure the device is able to pair, unpair, and update the model on our Home Hub. All of these devices are put into the hands of our customers.

Sometimes IoT device manufacturers find bugs in their firmware. It is still our duty to maintain a simple and enjoyable experience for our senior living customers.

Here is an example of a device's description file:

```json
  cls : nest.3rdGen.thermostat,
    commands: {
          setCool: {
                “type”: “function”,
                “args”: {
                      “type”: “number”,
                      “required”: true,
                      “options”: {
                            “min”: 61,
                            “max”: 122
                        }
                    }
              },
      },
      “variables”: {
            “temp”: {
                  “type”: “number”
              },
      },
      “properties”: {
            “displaysCelsius”: {
                  “type”: “boolean”
            },
      }
```
