## Overview

Integrating an IoT device onto our Home Hub requires a specific set of JSON files. These JSON files have variables, properties, and commands related to that particular IoT device.

We noticed an opportunity for process improvement when we had to update a value on a JSON file for a device in production.

In the old process, after making the update for the device, we still had to create a new build in order to get the change onto our Home Hub.

In the new process, we integrated AWS S3 to bypass creating a whole new build for these minor JSON file changes.

The idea was to have our Home Hub watch AWS S3 for any new device files that were dropped in it. Whenever it saw a new JSON file, the Home Hub would download it and apply the changes to the deviceâ€™s model.

This AWS integration was made available in all environments - dev, staging, and production - to streamline our support process for any IoT device.

## Complexities

The new process depended on a manifest.json file, which was also kept in AWS S3. The manifest file was a list of required devices that the Home Hub should check for in S3. After downloading all the required JSON files, then the Home Hub can start its servers and bridges.
