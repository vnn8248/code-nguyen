            Over the past 10 years, I've worked in various roles along the
            software development lifecycle. I have experience as a business
            analyst, product owner, and now, I've gone to the Dark Side - I'm in
            dev.

            I'm proud to have worn many hats in my career. Throughout my journey
            I learned that there is always a human behind everything - even
            technology. Someone is using a product, someone has written that
            code, or someone is working with me in this moment. Treating design,
            development, and support with that in mind is how I've learned to
            grow as a person - not just as a software engineer.

              The best projects I've worked on all had true teamwork. It was
              more than, "do your part and I'll do mine". It was more than just
              top-down economics. It was an inclusive and welcoming environment

              As a self-taught coder, one of the most important things I've
              learned along the way was how to be confident and curious at the
              same time. Imposter syndrome is a real thing. Embracing life-long

              I believe in mentorship. To be able to pass on knowledge in a
              meaningful way is a skill that I think is undervalued and
              underappreciated. This is something that I prioritize as highly as
              any other tech skill that I could learn.

          In a previous life, I was once a product owner. It gave me crucial
          skills in communication, organization, and planning. I get asked a lot
          about why I decided to switch to dev. Apparently, it's typical for
          someone to switch from dev to product but not the other way around.

          I decided to learn how to code while I was doing my job as a product
          owner. I figured, at the least, it would help me empathize better with
          my dev teams. And, to be honest, I was slightly envious of the
          esoteric aura that clouded the developers. Little did I know, when I
          rendered my first 'Hello World', that I had walked into a whole new
          universe where the possibilities were endless.

          When I'm back on Earth I enjoy chasing all my interests. I like
          writing at a good coffee shop, finding a local pickup soccer game,
          listening to good music, cooking, biking, reading graphic novels, and
          traveling to world.
